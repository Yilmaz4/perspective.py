# Contributing
Thanks in advance for investing your time to contribute to this project! This is a quite small and simple project therefore it would be pretty hard to find something to add to this project, hence I don't think you can come up with an interesting idea to add :). However, as I'm considerably new to developing libraries for Python, there may be some bugs or you may have an idea to improve the ease of usage. I would appreciate if you share your idea or your solution to a bug in either Issues tab or make a pull request.

I'm currently looking forward for updates on Perspective API, such as the context thing and some new attributes. I still haven't fully understood the capabilities of Perspective API; so if you've, it would be great if you share it with me! As far as I know, you can currently only get score values for text. And if I didn't make a mistake in the code, experimental versions of production-ready attributes do NOT support any languages. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

That's all I can say about contributing to this project. I hope you liked this project and would like to improve it more :).
